# Importing Images (beta)

While Shifter is primarily design to run images built using Docker, it also
supports directly importing pre-prepared images.  Since some sites may not
wish to support this or limit its usage, it requires extra configuration.

## Approach

Importing images works by copying a pre-prepared image into the shared
location, generating a pseudo-hash for the image, and adding an entry in
the Shifter image list.

## Enabling support

To enable support, add an "ImportUsers" parameters into the top section of
the imagemanager.json file.  This can be a list of user names (in JSON list
format) or the keyword "all".  For example:

~~~~
...
"ExpandDirectory": "/tmp/images/expand/",
"ImportUsers":"all"
"Locations": {
...
~~~~

The fasthash script needs to be installed as `fasthash` in a location on
the search path for the image gateway for local mode or in the search path
on the remote system for remote mode.  This script generates a pseudo-hash
for the image based on the contents of the image.


## Usage

The user issuing the import most have the squashed image in a location that is
accessible by the shifter user (e.g. the account used to run the gateway).

The command line tools do not currently support import.  So a curl command
must be issued.  Here is an example of an import command to import the squashfs image
located at /tmp/image.squashfs and call it
load_test:v1 in Shifter.

~~~~bash
curl -d '{"filepath":"/tmp/myimage.squashfs","format":"squashfs"}' \
  -H "authentication: $(munge -n)" \
  http://<imagegw>:5000/api/doimport/mycluster/custom/load_test:v1/
~~~~

Once an image is imported, it is run with Shifter like other images.
The only difference is the type is "custom" instead of the default "docker".

```bash
shifter --image=custom:load_test:v1 /bin/app
```
