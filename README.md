# Shifter - Containers for HPC

Shifter enables container images for HPC.  In a nutshell, Shifter allows an HPC system to efficiently and safely allow end-users 
to run a docker image.  Shifter consists of a few moving parts 1) a utility that typically runs on the compute node that creates
the run time environment for the application 2) an image gateway service that pulls images from a registry and repacks it in a 
format suitable for the HPC system (typically squashfs) 3) and example scripts/plugins to integrate Shifter with various batch
scheduler systems.
