#optUdiImage
#
#Absolute path to the udiImage directory to be bind-mounted onto /opt/udiImage. 
#This is typically pre-built with shifter to include an sshd, but you could add 
#other things if you so desire.
#
#Recommended value: /opt/shifter/udiRoot/default/deps/udiImage

etcPath=/opt/shifter/default/etc_files
#
#Absolute path to the files you want copied into /etc for every container. This 
#path must be root owned (including the files within), and it must contain, at 
#minimum, nsswitch.conf, passwd, group.
#
#Note that any files you put in this path will override whatever the user 
#included in their image.
#
#Recommended value: /opt/shifter/default/etc_files


#allowLocalChroot (0 or 1)
#
#shifter can be used to construct a "container" out a of local path instead of a 
#loop device filesystem. This can be useful if you have an unpacked layer you 
#want to examine, or to enable shifter services within an existing path. Setting 
#to 1 will allow this path-specified shifting, 0 will not.
#
#This must be enabled if the "ccm" emulation mode is desired. (ccm emulation is 
#effectively done with shifter --image=local:/ within the SLURM integration.


#autoLoadKernelModule (0 or 1)
#
#Flag to determine if kernel modules can be automatically loaded by shifter if 
#required. This is typically limited to loop, squashfs, ext4 (and its dependencies)
#
#Recommend 0 if you already load loop, squashfs, and ext4 as part of node bootup 
#process.
#
#Recommend 1 if you want to let shifter load them for you.


#mountUdiRootWritable (required)
#
#Flag to remount the udiMount VFS read-only after setup. This is typically only 
#needed for debugging, and should usually be set to 1.
#
#Recommended value: 1
#maxGroupCount (required)
#
#Maximum number of groups to allow. If the embedded sshd is being used, then this 
#should be set to 31. This is used when preparing the /etc/group file, which is 
#a filtered version of the group file you provide to shifter. The filtering is 
#done because the libc utilities for parsing an /etc/group file are typically 
#more limited than the LDAP counterparts. Since LDAP is not usable within 
#shifter, a filtered group file is used.
#
#Recommended value: 31


modprobePath=/sbin/modprobe
#
#Absolute path to known-good modprobe

insmodPath=/sbin/insmod
#
#Absolute path to known-good insmod

cpPath=/bin/cp
#
#Absolute path to known-good cp

mvPath=/bin/mv
#
#Absolute path to known-good mv

chmodPath=/bin/chmod
#
#Absolute path to known-good chmod

rootfsType=tmpfs
#
#The filesystem type to use for setting up the shifter VFS layer. This is 
#typically just tmpfs. On cray compute nodes (CLE 5.2), tmpfs will not work, 
#instead use rootfs. rootfs is only known to work in the CLE environment.
#
#Recommended value: tmpfs

#gatewayTimeout (optional)
#
#Time in seconds to wait for the imagegw to respond before failing over to next 
#(or failing).

#kmodBasePath
#
#Optional absolute path to where kernel modules are accessible -- up-to-but-not-
#including the kernel version directory. On many systems this will be /lib/modules, 
#on Cray systems where kernel modules are built as part of the installation process, 
#point to where you installed them (possibly under /opt/shifter/udiRoot/default/kmod)
#
#This is not necessary if autoLoadKernelModule is 0, and is required if it is 1.
#kmodCacheFile (deprecated)
#
#Do not use.

siteFs=/home
#
#Space seperated list of paths to be automatically bind-mounted into the container. 
#This is typically used to make network filesystems accessible within the 
#container, but could be used to allow certain other facilities, like /var/run 
#or /var/spool/alps to be accessible within the image (depending on your needs).
#
#Do not attempt to bind things under /usr or other common critical paths within 
#containers.
#
#It is OK to perform this under /var or /opt or a novel path that your site 
#maintains (e.g., for NERSC, /global).
#siteEnv
#
#Space seperated list of environment variables to automatically set (or add, or 
#replace) when a shifter container is setup.
#
#Example:
#


#siteEnv=SHIFTER_RUNTIME=1
#
#This can be useful if network home directories are mounted into the container 
#and you users want a way to prevent their localized dotfiles from running. (e.g., 
#do not execute if SHIFTER_RUNTIME is set).
#siteEnvAppend
#
#Space seperated list of environment variables to automatically append (or add) 
#when a shifter container is setup. This only makes sense for colon seperated 
#environment variables, .e.g, PATH.
#
#Example:
#

#siteEnvAppend=PATH=/opt/udiImage/bin
#
#This can be used if your site patches in a path that you want to appear in the 
#path. Recommend that all binaries are compatible with all containers, i.e., are 
#statically linked, to ensure they work.
#siteEnvPrepend
#
#Space seperated list of environment variables to automatically prepend (or add) 
#when a shifter container is setup. This only makes sense for colon seperated 
#environment variables, e.g., PATH.
#
#Example:
#

#siteEnvPrepend=PATH=/opt/udiImage/bin
#
#This can be used if your site patches in a path that you want to appear in the 
#path. Recommend that all binaries are compatible with all containers, i.e., are 
#statically linked, to ensure they work.

imageGateway=http://api:5000
#
#Space seperated URLs for your imagegw. Used by shifterimg and SLURM batch 
#integration to communicate with the imagegw.
#batchType (optional)
#
#Used by batch integration code to pick useful settings. May be deprecated in 
#the future as it is not necessary at this point.

system=systema
#
#Name of your system, e.g., edison or cori. This name must match a configured 
#system in the imagegw. This is primarily used by shifterimg to self-identify 
#which system it is representing.

nodeContextPrefix=
#
#Must be blank, e.g. put nodeContextPrefix= in your config file.
#
#Recommended value:

ddPath=/bin/dd

mkfsXfsPath=/sbin/mkfs.ext4
