 *     docker:someSpecificDockerUser/someRepo:1.4.2.3.4

 *     ubuntu:14.04
 * in which case no image type is specified which leads to the defaultImageType
 * from udiRoot.conf to be assumed.
 *
 * Once parsed these data are useful to either fully determine which image to
 * load (if type == id or type == local), or perform a lookup using from the
 * image manager via shifterimg (if type is anything else, but particularly
 * docker).
 *
 * The calling function will provide pointers to uninitialized char* instances
 * which are used to store the resulting type and tag values.  The calling
 * function is responsible to free the stored strings for imageType and
 * imageTag.
 *
 * \param userinput user-provided string in above format for desired image
 * \param imageType string pointer to store calculated image type
 * \param imageTag string pointer to store calucated image tag
 * \param udiConfig UdiRootConfig configuration structure
 * \returns 0 upon success, -1 upon error, any error should be fatal
