# udiRoot.conf
#
# See https://github.com/NERSC/shifter/wiki/config-reference
#
# udiRoot.conf is read by shifter and most other related shifter utilities within 
# the udiRoot component. Unless udiRoot is built enabling particular options 
# udiRoot.conf must be owned by root, but readable by all users, or at least all 
# users you want accessing shifter.
#
# Configuration File Format
#
# The file configuration format is a basic key=value, however space seperated 
# strings can be used for multiple options. Multiple lines can be used if the 
# final character on the line is '\'. Items cannot be quoted to allow spaces 
# within the configuration option.
#
# Configuration File Options
#
#udiMount (required)
#
# Absolute path to where shifter should generate a mount point for its own use. 
# This path to this should be writable by root and should not be in use for other purposes.
#
# Recommended value: /var/udiMount
udiMount=/var/udiMount

#loopMount (required)
#
# Absolute path to where shifter should mount loop device filesystems. This path 
# should be writable by root and should not be in use for other purposes.
#
# Recommended value: /var/udiLoopMount
loopMount=/var/udiLoopMount

#imagePath (required)
#
# Absolute path to where shifter can find images. This path should be readable by
# root. This path should be visible by all nodes in the system. It may be possible
# to use some kind of rsyncing method to have this path be local on all systems,
# but that may prove problematic if a user attempts to use an image while it is 
# being rsynced. Recommend using GPFS or lustre or similar.
imagePath=/images

# udiRootPath (required)
#
# Absolute path (can be a symlink) to where current version of udiRoot is 
# installed. This path is used to find all needed shifter-specific utilities 
# (shifter, shifterimg, setupRoot, unsetupRoot, mount, etc).
# In general, this should match the installation ${prefix} used when building.
#
# Recommended value: /opt/shifter/default
udiRootPath=@SHIFTER_PREFIX@

# sitePreMountHook
#
# Script to be run before bind-mounting the siteFs filesystems. This script needs
# to be root owned and executable by root. It should create any directories on 
# the path to the mount point, but not the mount point itself (e.g., mkdir -p 
# global but not mkdir -p global/u1 if your siteFs path is /global/u1 )
#
# Note that the script is executed within your udiMount directory and so all your
# paths within the script should be relative to that.
#
# Recommended value: /etc/opt/nersc/udiRoot/premount.sh
#sitePreMountHook=@SHIFTER_SYSCONFDIR@/premount.sh

# sitePostMountHook
#
# Script to be run after bind-mounting the siteFs filesystems. This script need to
# be root owned and executable by root. It should do any work required after 
# performing the mounts, e.g., generating a symlink.
#
# Note that the script is executed within your udiMount directory and so all your
# paths within the script should be relative to that.
#
# Recommended value: /etc/opt/nersc/udiRoot/postmount.sh
#sitePostMountHook=@SHIFTER_SYSCONFDIR@/postmount.sh

#optUdiImage
#
# Absolute path to the udiImage directory to be bind-mounted onto /opt/udiImage. 
# This is typically pre-built with shifter to include an sshd, but you could add 
# other things if you so desire.
#
# Recommended value: /opt/shifter/udiRoot/default/deps/udiImage
optUdiImage=@SHIFTER_LIBEXECDIR@/@PACKAGE_NAME@/opt/udiImage
#
# Absolute path to the files you want copied into /etc for every container. This 
# path must be root owned (including the files within), and it must contain, at 
# minimum, nsswitch.conf, passwd, group.
#
# Note that any files you put in this path will override whatever the user 
# included in their image.
#
# Recommended value: /opt/shifter/default/etc_files
etcPath=@SHIFTER_ETC_FILESDIR@


#allowLocalChroot (0 or 1)
#
# shifter can be used to construct a "container" out a of local path instead of a 
# loop device filesystem. This can be useful if you have an unpacked layer you 
# want to examine, or to enable shifter services within an existing path. Setting 
# to 1 will allow this path-specified shifting, 0 will not.
#
# This must be enabled if the "ccm" emulation mode is desired. (ccm emulation is 
# effectively done with shifter --image=local:/ within the SLURM integration.


#autoLoadKernelModule (0 or 1)
#
# Flag to determine if kernel modules can be automatically loaded by shifter if 
# required. This is typically limited to loop, squashfs, ext4 (and its dependencies)
#
# Recommend 0 if you already load loop, squashfs, and ext4 as part of node bootup 
# process.
#
# Recommend 1 if you want to let shifter load them for you.


#mountUdiRootWritable (required)
#
# Flag to remount the udiMount VFS read-only after setup. This is typically only 
# needed for debugging, and should usually be set to 1.
#
# Recommended value: 1
mountUdiRootWritable=1

#maxGroupCount (required)
#
# Maximum number of groups to allow. If the embedded sshd is being used, then this 
# should be set to 31. This is used when preparing the /etc/group file, which is 
# a filtered version of the group file you provide to shifter. The filtering is 
# done because the libc utilities for parsing an /etc/group file are typically 
# more limited than the LDAP counterparts. Since LDAP is not usable within 
# shifter, a filtered group file is used.
#
# Recommended value: 31
maxGroupCount=31

#modprobePath
#
# Absolute path to known-good modprobe
modprobePath=@MODPROBE_PATH@

#insmodPath (required)
#
# Absolute path to known-good insmod
insmodPath=@INSMOD_PATH@

#cpPath (required)
#
# Absolute path to known-good cp
cpPath=@CP_PATH@

#mvPath (required)
#
# Absolute path to known-good mv

#chmodPath
#
# Absolute path to known-good chmod

#mkfsXfsPath
#
# Absolute path to known-good mkfs.xfs
# mkfsXfsPath=@MKFSXFS_PATH@

#rootfsType
#
# The filesystem type to use for setting up the shifter VFS layer. This is 
# typically just tmpfs. On cray compute nodes (CLE 5.2), tmpfs will not work, 
# instead use ramfs.
#
# Recommended value: tmpfs
rootfsType=@ROOTFS_TYPE@

#gatewayTimeout (optional)
#
# Time in seconds to wait for the imagegw to respond before failing over to next 
# (or failing).

#kmodBasePath
#
# Optional absolute path to where kernel modules are accessible -- up-to-but-not-
# including the kernel version directory. On many systems this will be /lib/modules, 
# on Cray systems where kernel modules are built as part of the installation process, 
# point to where you installed them (possibly under /opt/shifter/udiRoot/default/kmod)
#
# This is not necessary if autoLoadKernelModule is 0, and is required if it is 1.


#kmodCacheFile (deprecated)
#
#Do not use.


#siteFs
#
# Semicolon seperated list of paths to be automatically bind-mounted into the
# container. This is typically used to make network filesystems accessible
# within the container, but could be used to allow certain other facilities,
# like /var/run  or /var/spool/alps to be accessible within the image (depending
# on your needs).
#
# Do not attempt to bind things under /usr or other common critical paths within 
# containers.
#
# It is OK to perform this under /var or /opt or a novel path that your site 
# maintains (e.g., for NERSC, /global).
siteFs=/home:/home


#siteEnv
#
# Space seperated list of environment variables to automatically set (or add, or 
# replace) when a shifter container is setup.
#
# This can be useful if network home directories are mounted into the container 
# and you users want a way to prevent their localized dotfiles from running. (e.g., 
# do not execute if SHIFTER_RUNTIME is set).
#
siteEnv=SHIFTER_RUNTIME=1


#siteEnvAppend
#
# Space seperated list of environment variables to automatically append (or add) 
# when a shifter container is setup. This only makes sense for colon seperated 
# environment variables, .e.g, PATH.
#
# This can be used if your site patches in a path that you want to appear in the 
# path. Recommend that all binaries are compatible with all containers, i.e., are 
# statically linked, to ensure they work.
#
siteEnvAppend=PATH=/opt/udiImage/bin


# siteEnvPrepend
#
# Space seperated list of environment variables to automatically prepend (or add) 
# when a shifter container is setup. This only makes sense for colon seperated 
# environment variables, e.g., PATH.
#
# This can be used if your site patches in a path that you want to appear in the 
# path. Recommend that all binaries are compatible with all containers, i.e., are 
# statically linked, to ensure they work.
#
#siteEnvPrepend=PATH=/opt/udiImage/bin


#imageGateway
#
# Space seperated URLs for your imagegw. Used by shifterimg and SLURM batch 
# integration to communicate with the imagegw.
# batchType (optional)
#
# Used by batch integration code to pick useful settings. May be deprecated in 
# the future as it is not necessary at this point.
#
imageGateway=http://imagegwapi:5000


#system (required)
#
# Name of your system, e.g., edison or cori. This name must match a configured 
# system in the imagegw. This is primarily used by shifterimg to self-identify 
# which system it is representing.
#
system=mycluster

#defaultImageType (required)
#
# Default image type for lookups and user input parsing.  This should almost
# certainly be set to "docker" for most systems.
#
defaultImageType=docker

#useOverlayFsMode (optional)
# Default is 0. Setting to 1 enables overlayfs functionality.
# useOverlayFsMode=0
